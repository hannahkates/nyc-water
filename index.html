      <h4>New York City's total water demand has decreased significantly over the past four decades.</h4>
      <p>In 1979, the city consumed over 1.5 billion gallons of water each day. Since then, the total daily consumption has dropped by about a third. In 2019, the daily total dropped to below a billion gallons each day. This includes all water used by households, businesses, industry, and lost through leaks in the water supply system.</p>

    <div class="text-container">
      <h4>This decrease is rather surprising, because NYC has experienced steady population growth throughout the same time period.</h4>
      <p>NYC's population has increased by over a million people since 1980. Only in the last few years, since 2016, has population growth begun to level off and slightly decline.</p>

    <div class="text-container">
      <h4>Even though there are more people, less water is consumed per person.</h4>
      <p>On a per capita basis, New Yorkers consume about 45% less water today than in 1980. Are individuals actually consuming that much less water?</p>

      <h4>What's driving this huge decrease in NYC's total water demand?</h4>
      <p>It turns out, the decreased water demand can be credited to a combination of forces.</p>
      <p>Metering</p>
      <p>Fixing leaks</p>
      <p>Incentive programs</p>

      <h4>Will it be sustained?</h4>
