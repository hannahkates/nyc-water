    <p>New York City's total water demand has decreased significantly over the past four decades.</p>

    <p>In 1979, the city consumed over 1.5 billion gallons of water each day. Since then, the total daily consumption has dropped by about a third. In 2019, the daily total decreased to below a billion gallons each day. This includes all water used by households, businesses, industry, and lost through leaks in the water supply system.</p>

    <p>This decrease is rather surprising, because NYC has experienced steady population growth throughout the same time period.</p>

    <p>NYC's population has increased by over a million people since 1980. Only in the last few years, since 2016, has population growth begun to level off and slightly decline.</p>

    <p>Even though there are more people, less water is consumed per person.</p>

    <p>On a per capita basis, New Yorkers consume about 45% less water today than in 1980. Are individuals each consciously consuming that much less water?</p>

    <h2>What has caused this decrease in NYC's total water demand?</h2>
    <p>The decreased water demand can be credited to a combination of government initiatives. Most of the efforts began in the mid-1980s, spurred by significant droughts in 1980, 1985, and 1989 that critically threatened NYC's water supply.</p>
    <p>In order to appreciate the rationale behind the City's different initiatives, it's helpful to first understand the breakdown of how water is used in NYC:<br><br>[INSERT d3 BUBBLE CHART INSTEAD]</p>

    </figure>
    <p>The largest segment is for residential use. Residential properties accounted for 84 percent of the city’s total billed water demand in 2018.</p>

    <h3>Metering.</h3>
    <p>
      Until the late 1980s and 1990s, residential property owners weren't accurately charged for their water usage. Buildings were simply charged a flat fee based on the street frontage and number of plumbing fixtures, regardless of how much water they actually consumed. It wasn't until 1985, thanks to Local Law 53, that the City required the installation of water meters at buildings. The law required all new construction and all substantially renovated properties to install water meters. In 1987, City Council approved a plan called “Universal Metering” that further required water meters to be installed at every property within the City over a 10-year period. The more accurate billing has motivated lower water consumption.

      </figure>
      It's important to recognize that in NYC, metering usually captures the usage of the entire residential building, not the individual apartments. Most of the old residential buildings are not designed in a way that can accommodate splitting water meters to monitor each of the tenants. The older buildings typically use a "riser" system where the water enters through the basement and is sent up to all bathroom and kitchen risers in the building; this makes it much more difficult to submeter per unit.
      <br><br>
      This also means that the individual tenants aren't incentivized to save water, and the impetus falls on the landlord who is responsible for the cost of the entire building. As of Sept 2020, the combined cost of water and sewer is $10.33 per 100 cubic feet. <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/pay-my-bills/how-we-bill-you.page">More info on the billing process</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Regulation and rebate programs.</h3>
    <p>In addition to metering, the City has implemented policies and programs to reduce water consumption in buildings. The City now requires water-saving fixtures and devices in major building renovations and new construction.</p>
    <p>Toilets are generally considered the most wasteful fixture. Older toilets average about 3.5-5.0 gallons of water per flush, whereas high-efficiency models consume as little as 1.28 gallons per flush. To mitigate the unappealing capital costs of replacing fixtures, the NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection has implemented two different programs aimed at toilet efficiency. The 1994-1997 Toilet Rebate Program facilitated the replacement of 1.3 million toilets citywide. The most recent 2014-2019 Toilet Replacement Program facilitated the replacement of 13,600 toilets.</p>
    <p>Additionally, NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection provides water conservation education for property owners and offers free surveys to help property owners detect leaks in the plumbing in their building.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection also has programs focused on savings in non-residential properties. The Water Challenge to Universities engages campus facility staff in water conservation strategies and promotes a water conservation ethic among students. So far, the participating universities have exceeded the original goal of the Challenge. Collectively, they have reduced their monthly average consumption by 11%, ~3.4 million gallons – amounting to a total annual average savings of 41,400,000 gallons.</p>

    <h3>Fixing leaks & reducing waste in the supply system.</h3>
    <p>Of particular concern now is the Delaware Aqueduct, which delivers approximately half of the city’s drinking water – 500 million gallons per day. It is leaking as much as 35 million gallons per day. New technologies have permitted DEP to perform inspections of it, and a major project to repair it is under way. Among other portions of the system that may need maintenance or repair, most notable are City Water Tunnel No. 1, completed in 1917, and City Water Tunnel No. 2, completed in 1936. They have been delivering water to our homes, businesses, and institutions continuously since they were placed in service. Because of concerns that a reduction in water pressure might damage part of the system, neither tunnel has ever been shut down for inspections and repairs. </p>
    <p>With nearly 7,000 miles of sub-surface water main infrastructure serving more than 8 million people throughout the five boroughs. Starting in _____ The City undertook a massive effort to fix leaks and waste in the water supply system. They have used sonar and other technology to find the leaks. However, with the City's aging infrastructure, it's impossible to completely eliminate leaks. Over the past five years, DEP leak detection crews have surveyed more than 3,750 miles of water mains. DEP has achieved an average estimated savings of 1.89 million gallons per day from repairing the leaks discovered during these surveys.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the City has installed sprinkler caps on fire hydrants that reduce flow. This makes the classic NYC summer usage of fire hydrants as cooling street fountains less wasteful. The spray caps can be requested at local fire stations.</p>

    <h2>Will it be sustained?</h2>
    <p>Much of the low hanging fruit may have already been claimed since the 1980s, but it seems likely that the total water demand will continue to decrease. City agencies are continuing to push forward multi-faceted conservation programs. Additionally, over time, more of the city's building stock will be rehabbed and reconstructed, incorporating better technology and therefore higher water efficiency. If NYC's population size continues to decline, that will also play an important role in reducing total demand. The 2020 Decennial Census will be very revealing!</p>
