    <p>New York City's total water demand has decreased significantly over the past four decades, despite a population increase of about one million.</p>
    <figure class="d3-chart">
      <div class="step" data-step="a" id="chart-total"></div>
      <figcaption>Source: <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-In-The-New-York-City/ia2d-e54m">NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In 1979, the city consumed over 1.5 billion gallons of water each day. Since then, the total daily consumption has dropped by about a third. In 2019, the daily total decreased to below a billion gallons each day. This includes all water used by households, businesses, industry, and lost through leaks in the water supply system.</p>

    <p>This decrease is rather surprising, because NYC has experienced steady population growth throughout the same time period.</p>
    <figure class="d3-chart">
      <div class="step" data-step="b" id="chart-population"></div>

    </figure>
    <p>NYC's population has increased by over a million people since 1980. Only in the last few years, since 2016, has population growth begun to level off and slightly decline.</p>

    <p>Even though there are more people, less water is consumed per person.</p>
    <figure class="d3-chart">
      <div class="step" data-step="c" id="chart-per-capita"></div>
      <figcaption>Source: <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-In-The-New-York-City/ia2d-e54m">NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>On a per capita basis, New Yorkers consume about 45% less water today than in 1980. Are individuals each consciously consuming that much less water?</p>

    <h2>What has caused this decrease in NYC's total water demand?</h2>
    <p>A combination of successful government initiatives deserve credit for the decreased water demand, including metering, regulation, and conservation programs. Most of the efforts began in the mid-1980s, spurred by significant droughts in 1980, 1985, and 1989 that critically threatened NYC's water supply.</p>
    <p>In order to appreciate the reasoning behind the City's different initiatives, it's helpful to first understand the breakdown of how water is used in NYC:</p>
    <figure class="d3-chart">
      <div class="step" data-step="d" id="chart-bubble"></div>
      <figcaption>Chart showing the percentage breakdown of how water is used in NYC, using data from 2011. Source: <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/em/downloads/pdf/hazard_mitigation/nycs_risk_landscape_chapter_4.7_watershortage.pdf">NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>By far, the largest demand segment is residential and mixed-use residential. Next, about a fifth of the city's total water demand goes to "non-revenue" usage. Non-revenue water is water that is produced by the water supply system but never reaches a customer due to leaks and other losses.</p>

    <h3>Metering.</h3>
    <p>
      Until the late 1980s and 1990s, residential property owners weren't accurately charged for their water usage. Buildings were simply charged a flat fee based on the street frontage and number of plumbing fixtures, regardless of how much water they consumed. It wasn't until 1985, thanks to Local Law 53, that the City required the installation of water meters. The law required all new construction and all substantially renovated properties to install water meters. In 1987, City Council approved a plan called “Universal Metering” that further required meters to be installed at every property within the City over a 10-year period. The more accurate billing has motivated lower water consumption.
      <figure class="float-left">

      </figure>
      It's important to recognize that, in NYC, metering usually captures the usage of the entire residential building, rather than the individual apartments. Most of the old residential buildings are not designed in a way that can accommodate splitting water meters to monitor each tenant. The older buildings typically use a "riser" system where the water enters through the basement and is sent up to all bathroom and kitchen risers in the building; this makes it much more difficult to submeter per unit.
      <br><br>
      This also means that the individual tenants aren't incentivized to save water. The impetus falls on the landlord who is responsible for the cost of the entire building. As of Sept 2020, the combined cost of water and sewer is $10.33 per 100 cubic feet. <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/pay-my-bills/how-we-bill-you.page">More info on the billing process</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Regulation and rebate programs.</h3>
    <p>In addition to metering, the City has implemented policies and programs to reduce water consumption in buildings. The City now requires water-saving fixtures and devices in major building renovations and new construction.</p>
    <p>Toilets are generally considered the most wasteful fixture. Older toilets average about 3.5-5.0 gallons of water per flush, whereas high-efficiency models consume as little as 1.28 gallons per flush. To mitigate the unappealing capital costs of replacing fixtures, the NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection has implemented two different programs aimed at toilet efficiency. The 1994-1997 Toilet Rebate Program facilitated the replacement of 1.3 million toilets citywide. The most recent 2014-2019 Toilet Replacement Program facilitated the replacement of 13,600 toilets.</p>
    <p>Additionally, NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection provides water conservation education for property owners and offers free surveys to help property owners detect leaks in the plumbing in their building.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection also has programs focused on savings in non-residential properties. One success story is the The Water Challenge to Universities, which engages campus facility staff in water conservation strategies and promotes a water conservation ethic among students.</p>

    <h3>Fixing leaks & reducing waste in the supply system.</h3>
    <p>The City has worked to minimize the amount of water that doesn't generate revenue, i.e. eliminating waste in the infrastructure that supplies water to buildings. NYC has about 7,000 miles of sub-surface water main infrastructure. The vast network consists of aging pipes that are prone to developing leaks. The City uses sonar and other technology to find the leaks, and it has achieved an average estimated savings of 1.89 million gallons per day from repairing them.</p>
    <p>However, given the City's vast aging infrastructure, it's practically impossible to completely eliminate leaks. The Delaware Aqueduct is an important example of a massive, complicated leak. The aqueduct delivers approximately half of the city’s drinking water, ~500 million gallons per day. Meanwhile, it is leaking as much as 35 million gallons per day. New technologies have facilitated inspections, and a major repair project is now under way.</p>

      <figcaption class="float-left">Map of the tunnels that supply NYC with water. Source: <a href="https://www.enr.com/articles/39369-new-york-city-outlines-plan-to-complete-third-water-tunnel">ENR / NYC Department of Environmental Protection</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>It is suspected that City Water Tunnel No. 1 (completed in 1917) and City Water Tunnel No. 2 (completed in 1936) are both leaking as well. They have operated continuously since they were placed in service. Neither tunnel has ever been shut down for inspections and repairs, because reduced water pressure might damage the system. Water Tunnel No. 3 will provide much needed backup for the two tunnels, allowing their condition to finally be examined.</p>
    <p>Beyond leaks in the system, the City has worked to reduce other instances of waste in the water supply system. As classic NYC summer scene is the usage of fire hydrants as cooling street fountains. The City has installed sprinkler caps on fire hydrants that reduce flow, in order to make their fountain usage less wasteful. The spray caps can be requested at local fire stations.</p>

    </figure>

    <h3>Improved efficiency at City facilities.</h3>
    <p>The City has also been working to improve water efficiency at its own municipal facilities. Projects include installing water efficient fixtures in public schools, parks, and government offices, and reusing water from fire department training and testing exercises.</p>

    <h2>Will it be sustained?</h2>
    <p>Much of the low hanging fruit may have already been claimed since the 1980s, but it seems likely that the total water demand will continue to decrease. City agencies are continuing to push forward multi-faceted conservation programs. Additionally, over time, more of the city's building stock will be rehabbed and reconstructed, incorporating better technology and therefore higher water efficiency. If NYC's population size continues to decline, that will also play an important role in reducing total demand. The 2020 Decennial Census will be very revealing!</p>
