    <p class="takeaway">New York City's total water demand has decreased significantly over the past four decades.</p>
    <p>In 1979, the city consumed over 1.5 billion gallons of water each day. Since then, the total daily consumption has dropped by about a third. In 2019, the daily total decreased to below a billion gallons each day. This includes all water used by households, businesses, industry, and lost through leaks in the water supply system.</p>
    <div class="step" data-step="a" id="chart-total"></div>

    <p class="takeaway">This decrease is rather surprising, because NYC has experienced steady population growth throughout the same time period.</p>
    <p>NYC's population has increased by over a million people since 1980. Only in the last few years, since 2016, has population growth begun to level off and slightly decline.</p>
    <div class="step" data-step="b" id="chart-population"></div>

    <p class="takeaway">Even though there are more people, less water is consumed per person.</p>
    <p>On a per capita basis, New Yorkers consume about 45% less water today than in 1980. Are individuals each consciously consuming that much less water?</p>
    <div class="step" data-step="c" id="chart-per-capita"></div>

    <p class="takeaway">What has caused this decrease in NYC's total water demand?</p>
    <p>The decreased water demand can be credited to a combination of government initiatives. Most of the efforts began in the mid-1980s, spurred by significant droughts in 1980, 1985, and 1989 that critically threatened NYC's water supply.</p>
    <h3>Metering.</h3>
    <p>      Until the late 1980s and 1990s, residential property owners weren't accurately charged for their water usage. Buildings were simply charged a flat fee based on the street frontage and number of plumbing fixtures, regardless of how much water they actually consumed. It wasn't until 1985, thanks to Local Law 53, that the City required the installation of water meters at buildings. The law required all new construction and all substantially renovated properties to install water meters. In 1987, City Council approved a plan called “Universal Metering” that further required water meters to be installed at every property within the City over a 10-year period.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to note that metering occurs at the building level, not at the individual dwelling unit level. However, the more granular and scaled pricing has still motivated lower water consumption overall. As of Sept 2020, the combined cost of water and sewer is $10.33 per 100 cubic feet. There is a minimum water and sewer charge per metered household of $1.27 per day. <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/pay-my-bills/how-we-bill-you.page">More info on billing</a>.

    <h3>Fixing leaks.</h3>
    <p>Starting in _____ The City undertook a massive effort to fix leaks and waste in the water supply system. They have used sonar and other technology to find the leaks. Additionally, they have installed sprinkler caps on fire hydrants during the summer to make the classic NYC street fountain usage less wasteful. The spray caps can be requested at the local fire station.</p>

    <h3>Regulation and incentive programs.</h3>
    <p> The City requires water-saving fixtures and devices in building renovations and new construction</p>
